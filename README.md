In today's information-rich world, it's often challenging to read and comprehend long documents. Text summarization can be a valuable tool for quickly understanding the main points of an article, report, or any piece of text. This project offers a user-friendly web application that leverages the capabilities of large language models to provide text summarization.

### Features

- Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Offers a web-based user interface for text input.
- Generates concise summaries based on the provided text.
- Customizable summary length parameters.
- Simple and intuitive user experience.
